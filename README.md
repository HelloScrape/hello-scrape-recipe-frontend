# HelloScrape Frontend

## Introduction

HelloScrape Frontend is a Svelte webapp that displays a large list of Hello Fresh recipes.
This is a **personal** hobby project and all the recipes shown are gathered from the **public** Hello Fresh website "https://www.hellofresh.nl/about/nieuws".

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# Or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
